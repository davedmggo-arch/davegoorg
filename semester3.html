By the end of this semester, you'll be able to create basic 3D objects with proper topology and form, understanding how your 2D design knowledge translates into 3D space.</li><li><b>Create Meaningful Props:</b> You'll learn to design and build props that aren't just visually interesting but also serve a narrative purpose. You'll discover how to use reference materials effectively to create props that feel authentic to your chosen theme and audience.</li><li><b>Design Compelling Characters:</b> You'll develop the skills to create simple but effective characters that communicate personality through their form and silhouette. You'll understand how character design connects to environment and audience, making your creations more impactful.</li><li><b>Build Immersive Environments:</b> You'll combine your props, characters, and spatial design skills to create interior environments that tell stories. You'll learn how composition, lighting, and layout work together to create spaces that feel alive and purposeful.</li></ul>

Having a personal library of "funpacks" (reference materials) will make your designs more authentic and detailed. Don't just look at how things appear—study how they're constructed, how they function, and what story they tell.</li><li><b>Start Simple, Add Details Later:</b> Always begin your projects with simple shapes (called "blockouts") before adding complex details. This approach helps you maintain proper proportions and overall design integrity. Think of it like sketching before adding ink—you wouldn't start a drawing with tiny details without first establishing the overall form!</li><li><b>Master Shortcuts Gradually: </b>Don't try to memorize all Blender shortcuts at once! Learn them in groups related to what you're doing (navigation, selection, modeling). Create your own cheat sheet and add to it as you learn new shortcuts. This builds muscle memory naturally without overwhelming you.</li><li><b>Embrace Feedback: </b>Participate actively in peer review sessions. Learning to give and receive constructive feedback is crucial in the creative industry. When presenting your work, use the terminology you're learning—it helps you think more professionally about your creations.</li></ul></div>

                                    You will create a simple character that would inhabit or use the space and objects from your previous project. The character should be designed without fur or hair, using a relatively low polygon count suitable for beginners to sculpt. Focus on creating a strong silhouette and clear form that communicates the character's personality and function within your chosen theme and target audience. You will learn about character components - the individual elements that combine to create a cohesive character design.

This enclosed space should tell a story about who lives or works there and what they do, specifically tailored to your target audience. The environment should be designed to complement your existing elements while creating a cohesive, unified scene. You will learn about layout design - the art of composing spaces to guide viewer attention and create effective storytelling.
